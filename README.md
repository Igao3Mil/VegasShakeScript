# This is a fork!
I didn't write any of this code!
I just forked and changed some little things to make it easier to download and use.

# VegasShakeScript

A Simple camera shake scrpit written in C# for Sony/Magix Vegas that uses Pan/crop keyframes to make the selected layer shake.

# Installation 

As the actual script, the installation is very simple too.
+ Download the [VegasShakeScript.cs](https://github.com/zigordlc/VegasShakeScript/releases/download/pre-v1.0.0/VegasShakeScript.cs) if you are using Magix Vegas 14 or newer.
+ Download the [VegasShakeScriptLegacy.cs](https://github.com/zigordlc/VegasShakeScript/releases/download/pre-v1.0.0/VegasShakeScriptLegacy.cs) if you are using Sony Vegas 13 or earlier.

Now, take that file and place it in one of the directories;

+ For Vegas 14+, navigate to the directory:

```
C:\Program Files\VEGAS\VEGAS Pro <version>\Script Menu
```

+ For Vegas 13-, the directory is:

```
C:\Program Files\Sony\VEGAS Pro <version>\Script Menu
```

# Usage
Open your Vegas Pro, navigate to `Tools`, then `Scripting`, and finally, `VegasShakeScript`.

# Notes
As I said in the very top of this readme file, I didn't wrote any of the code for the script. This is a forked repository, that I made because I didn't liked how the original looks. I also did some little changes to the code, so it works with newer versions of the program.

If you have any questions or issues, make sure to check out the [original repository](https://github.com/tmarplatt/VegasScripts), since it will probably be better for code related things, and also has the source code without any modifications.
